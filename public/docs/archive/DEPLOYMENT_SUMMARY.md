# IntegrateWise - Production Deployment Summary


> **Tier C — Historical.** This document is a point-in-time snapshot preserved for reference. For current architecture, see [CANONICAL_PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md](../architecture/CANONICAL_PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Status: ✅ Live on Vercel

**Production URLs:**
- Main: https://web-ng9lpex48-integratewises-projects.vercel.app
- Alias: https://web-two-chi-13.vercel.app
- Demo (Public): `/demo` route (no auth required for layer switcher demo)

---

## What Was Deployed

### 1. **Restored Deployed App**
- Recovered the live app from: https://v0-integrate-wise-operating-system-9gg7ctap4-integratewize.vercel.app/
- Fixed 13 build errors (duplicate routes, components, missing UI modules)
- Cleaned up complex views, restored simple stubs
- Build: ✅ Successful (8.9 MB Next.js dist)

### 2. **Three-Spine Architecture Added**
Backend infrastructure created:
- `ai-spine-schema.ts` — AI Spine with REASONING_TRACE, PROPOSAL, SIGNAL, CONFIDENCE entities
- `collaboration-spine-schema.ts` — Collaboration Spine with APPROVAL, COMPOUND_OUTCOME, MEMORY_COMPOUND
- `spine-lifecycle.ts` — Unified API routes (INTAKE → PROMOTION → MEMORY → DECAY → CONTINUITY phases)

Frontend integration:
- `domain-types.ts` — L1-L4 layer configuration
- `use-spine.ts` — React hooks for multi-spine data fetching
- `domain-sidebar.tsx` — Layer navigation component

### 3. **Layer Switcher in Sidebar**
Added "Active Spine" section to main sidebar with four buttons:
- **Human** (Blue) - L1: Your decisions & outcomes
- **AI** (Purple) - L3: Reasoning & proposals
- **Collaborate** (Amber) - L2: Joint outcomes & memory
- **Approve** (Green) - L4: Governance & compliance

### 4. **Environment Variables**
Configured in Vercel project:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://web-ng9lpex48-integratewises-projects.vercel.app
```

Backend services on Cloudflare Workers:
- Gateway: `https://integratewise-gateway.*.workers.dev`
- Spine: `https://integratewise-spine.*.workers.dev`
- Twin (AI): `https://integratewise-twin.*.workers.dev`
- Governance: `https://integratewise-governance.*.workers.dev`

## How It Works

### Sidebar Navigation (Same App, Multiple Views)
User clicks layer button in sidebar → View switches spine projection → Same data, different lens

**Example Flow:**
1. Human records goal in "Human" spine → Stores in INTAKE phase
2. User clicks "AI" layer → View shows AI proposals based on that goal
3. User clicks "Collaborate" → View shows joint approval workflow
4. User clicks "Approve" → Governance/compliance view

### Lifecycle (All Three Spines Follow Same Pattern)
```
INTAKE (Signal enters) 
  ↓
PROMOTION (Signal validates & promotes)
  ↓
MEMORY (Stored as ground truth)
  ↓
DECAY (Old signals archived)
  ↓
CONTINUITY (Outcomes compounded)
```

## Routes Deployed
✅ 62 routes successfully built:
- /today, /tasks, /work-queue, /iq-hub, /integrations
- /cs/accounts, /cs/contacts, /cs/meetings
- /sales, /marketing, /operations
- /intelligence, /agents, /pipelines
- /settings, /governance, /security
- /demo (Public demo of layer switcher)
- ...and 40+ more

---

## Demo Access

**Public Demo Route:**
https://web-ng9lpex48-integratewises-projects.vercel.app/demo

Shows:
- Sidebar with embedded layer switcher
- Interactive buttons for each spine (Record Goal, Generate Proposal, Record Approval)
- Real-time lifecycle trace log
- Three-spine architecture visualization

**Protected Routes:**
All other routes require Supabase authentication (via /login)

---

## Next Phase

1. **Wire Backend Data** — Connect Supabase tables to spine-lifecycle APIs
2. **Test Auth Flow** — Verify Supabase login, session management, RLS policies
3. **Scale to Tenants** — Replicate Customer Zero architecture to 10+ test tenants
4. **Add Integrations** — Wire Cloudflare Workers to handle inbound data
5. **Schema AI** — Build adaptive schema reasoning layer (Stages 3 & 5 blocker)

---
