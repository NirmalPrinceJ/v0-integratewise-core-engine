## I. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

IntegrateWise is a **unified intelligence operating system** that connects fragmented enterprise tools into one coherent, governed, reasoning workspace. The system has three core layers:

1. **User Facing (L1-L4):** Domain workbenches, cognitive overlays, twin reasoning, and memory management
2. **Intelligence Engine (Backend):** 28 Cloudflare Workers orchestrating data ingestion, normalization, analysis, governance, and execution
3. **Data Foundation (Spine):** Normalized canonical entities, relationships, signals, and organizational memory

**Core Axiom:** One Spine. Many projections. The Spine is the source of truth; every surface is a view of it.

## III. THE THREE-SPINE ARCHITECTURE

IntegrateWise implements a unique **three-spine lifecycle** where all signals (human decisions, AI reasoning, and joint approvals) flow through a unified state machine:

### A. Human Spine (L1 - Ground Truth)

**Purpose:** Record human goals, decisions, and outcomes as canonical ground truth.

**Data Storage:** D1/Supabase SPINE table  
**Lifecycle Flow:** INTAKE → PROMOTION → MEMORY → DECAY → CONTINUITY

**Example:** User creates quarterly revenue goal → validated → stored in MEMORY phase → triggers continuity compounding

**Key Entities:**
- Goals
- Outcomes  
- Decisions
- Approvals

---

### B. AI Spine (L3 - Intelligence Layer)

**Purpose:** Generate reasoning traces, proposals, and signals with confidence scores.

**Data Storage:** D1/Supabase AI_SPINE table  
**Lifecycle Flow:** Same as Human Spine (INTAKE through CONTINUITY)

**Example:** Twin analyzes customer churn signal → generates proposal → reasoning trace stored → confidence scored

**Key Entities:**
- REASONING_TRACE: Chain-of-thought + evidence
- PROPOSAL: Recommended actions with success criteria
- SIGNAL: Pattern detection + anomalies
- CONFIDENCE: Probability/reliability metrics

---

### C. Collaboration Spine (L2 - Joint Decision Making)

**Purpose:** Record approvals, feedback, and compounded outcomes from human-AI collaboration.

**Data Storage:** D1/Supabase COLLABORATION_SPINE table  
**Lifecycle Flow:** Same as Human Spine (INTAKE through CONTINUITY)

**Example:** Human approves AI proposal → joint outcome recorded → memory compounds for next cycle

**Key Entities:**
- APPROVAL: Human approval decisions
- FEEDBACK: Human course corrections
- COMPOUND_OUTCOME: Joint decision + outcome
- COLLABORATION_TRACE: Interaction history

---

### D. Unified Lifecycle (All Three Spines)

```
INTAKE
  ↓ (Signal enters the system)
PROMOTION
  ↓ (Validates, resolves, ready to act)
MEMORY
  ↓ (Stored as ground truth)
DECAY
  ↓ (Aged signals archived)
CONTINUITY
  ↓ (Outcome stored in continuity graph for future learning)
```

**Every signal** (human, AI, or collaborative) flows through these five phases. The system guarantees:
- No action without approval (governance gate)
- Full audit trail (all phases logged)
- Learning loop (outcomes feed back into system memory)
- Tenant isolation (all operations scoped to `tenant_id`)

---

## IV. BACKEND SERVICES ARCHITECTURE (28 Workers)

### 5.2 Layer Switcher (Sidebar Navigation)

The **Layer Switcher** is the core navigation metaphor. Four buttons in the sidebar allow users to switch between spines:

1. **Human (Blue)** - L1: Personal goals and decisions
2. **AI (Purple)** - L3: Twin reasoning and proposals
3. **Collaborate (Amber)** - L2: Joint approvals and memory
4. **Approve (Green)** - L4: Governance and audit

**All four layers exist in the same app.** Switching between them changes the data projection without a page reload.

### 5.3 Domain Sidebar

Workbenches are scoped by **domain** (Customer Success, Sales, Marketing, etc.). The domain sidebar includes:

- Active domain indicator
- Domain switcher (if user has multiple domains)
- Spine layer selector (Human/AI/Collaborate/Approve)
- Quick actions (create goal, search, settings)
- Integration status

### 5.4 Key Surfaces

| Surface | Purpose | Data Source | Interaction |
|---------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **L1 Workbench** | Primary operational interface | Spine (domain partition) | Read/create goals, view entities |
| **L2 Cognitive Overlay** | Intelligence layer (`⌘J`) | Intelligence service signals | Read-only, promote to proposal |
| **L3 Twin Chat** | Reasoning and planning | IW-Agent-Runtime | Chat, ask Twin, get proposals |
| **L4 Memory** | Search + documents | Knowledge service + Hermes | Full-text + semantic search |
| **Approval Center** | Governance | GOVERN service queue | Review, approve, reject proposals |
| **Public Demo** | Non-authenticated demo | Hard-coded sample data | Read-only visualization |

---

## VI. DATA LAYER ARCHITECTURE

### 6.1 Dual Storage Strategy

**D1 (Edge, Hot):**
- Domain partitions (`person_data`, `account_data`, `opportunity_data`, etc.)
- Signal cache
- Twin sessions
- Execution queue
- Continuity graph

**Supabase Fortress (SSOT, Authoritative):**
- Source of truth for all entities
- Audit logs
- Memory tables (org_memory, personal_memory)
- Billing + usage logs
- Row-level security (RLS) for multi-tenancy

### 6.2 Spine Entity Model

**Canonical Entity Types:** 18 core types resolved from any tool

```
PERSON, ACCOUNT, OPPORTUNITY, TICKET, ACTIVITY,
MESSAGE, DOCUMENT, GOAL, WORKFLOW, SIGNAL,
DECISION, APPROVAL, EXECUTION, OUTCOME,
ORGANIZATION, TEAM, RESOURCE, CUSTOM
```

**Canonical Traits:** 18 core attributes common across all entities

```
external_id, name, email, phone, status, owner_id,
created_at, updated_at, source_system, confidence,
tags, custom_fields, relationships, signals
```

**Domain Partitions:** 12 logical domains, each with entity-specific tables

```
CUSTOMER_SUCCESS: person, account, ticket, health_score
SALES: opportunity, activity, deal_stage, forecast
MARKETING: campaign, contact, engagement, lead_score
REVOPS: forecast, quota, territory, pipeline
FINANCE: invoice, expense, budget, forecast
[8+ more]
```

### 6.3 Relationships & Entity 360

**Relationship Graph:**
- Stores: `person` ← works-for → `account`, `person` ← owns → `opportunity`, etc.
- Assembled on read from Spine (no materialized `relationships` table; expensive reads are cached in KV)
- Enables Entity 360: Single view of a person across all connected systems

---

## VII. DEPLOYMENT & OPERATIONS

### 7.1 Environments

```
dev  → localhost (pnpm dev)
test → staging.integratewise.ai (pre-production)
prod → app.integratewise.ai (live)
```

### 7.2 Deployment Targets

**Cloudflare Workers:**
- Deploy with `pnpm deploy:prod` (all 28 workers)
- Staging: `pnpm deploy:test`
- Each worker has own `wrangler.toml`

**Next.js Frontend:**
- Deployed to Vercel (automatic on Git push to main)
- Environment variables via Vercel dashboard
- Staging branch → staging-web.integratewise.ai

**Database:**
- D1: Cloudflare-managed SQLite (auto-replicated)
- Supabase: Direct SQL + managed auth

### 7.3 Monitoring & Alerts

**Observability Stack:**
- Sentry (error tracking)
- Grafana (metrics)
- Cloudflare Analytics
- Custom telemetry service

**Key Metrics:**
- P95 latency per worker
- Error rate (5xx, 4xx)
- Database query time
- Memory usage (continuity lifecycle)
- Approval SLA (target: <1min human review time)

---

## VIII. SECURITY MODEL

### 8.1 Authentication & Authorization

**Auth Layer:** Supabase Auth (email + password, OAuth via Google/GitHub)  
**Session Management:** JWT tokens stored in secure httpOnly cookies  
**RBAC:** Role-based access control per tenant + domain  
**MFA:** Optional per organization (SSO for enterprise)

### 8.2 Data Isolation

**Row-Level Security (RLS):** Supabase enforces `tenant_id` filtering at DB layer  
**Worker Bindings:** Zero-trust internal routing; no worker exposed to public  
**Encryption:** TLS in transit, at-rest encryption for sensitive data (vault)  
**Audit Trail:** Every action logged (actor, timestamp, approval status, outcome)

### 8.3 Third-Party Integration Security

**OAuth Tokens:** Stored encrypted in Supabase, never transmitted to client  
**Webhook HMAC:** All webhooks verified with provider signatures  
**Rate Limiting:** Per-tenant + per-tool rate limits enforced at Gateway  
**Secrets Management:** Doppler for env vars, Cloudflare Workers Secrets for service credentials

---

## IX. OBSERVABILITY & LOGGING

### 9.1 Logging Strategy

**No local logging.** 100% cloud audit trail:

- **Direct writes:** Workers write to D1 + Supabase
- **Queue-mediated:** Normalizer, Pipeline, Continuity enqueue → process → commit
- **Audit logs:** `audit_logs` table (actor, action, timestamp, result)
- **Governance logs:** `governance_audit_log` (approval chain)
- **Spine logs:** `spine_audit_log` (entity writes)

### 9.2 Observability Points

| System | Metrics | Logs | Traces |
|--------|---------|------|--------|
| **Gateway** | Requests/sec, error rate, latency P95 | Auth failures, rate limits | Request → downstream |
| **Normalizer** | Events processed, LLM cost, errors | Classification, mapping errors | Entity resolution |
| **Pipeline** | Entities written, relationships added | Duplicates, conflicts | Spine write path |
| **Continuity** | Signals triaged, promoted, decayed | Lifecycle transitions | Memory consolidation |
| **Twin** | Conversations, proposals generated | Reasoning traces | Chat turns |
| **Govern** | Approvals/rejections, SLA | Governance decisions | Approval path |

---

## X. SCALABILITY & PERFORMANCE

### 10.1 Architecture for Scale

**Cloudflare Workers:** Auto-scales horizontally, no cold starts  
**D1 Database:** SQLite with auto-replication, sub-10ms reads  
**AI Search:** Vector embeddings in Cloudflare, <50ms semantic search  
**Queue Pattern:** Durable Objects for singleton work (one continuity processor per tenant)  
**Caching:** KV for entity 360 (5min TTL), signal cache (1min TTL)

### 10.2 Bottlenecks & Mitigations

| Bottleneck | Current | Mitigation |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| LLM inference cost | Paid once per entity (normalizer) | Batch inference, cache schema |
| Continuity processing | Single Durable Object per tenant | Sharded processor for large orgs |
| Entity 360 assembly | Materialized in KV | Read-through cache with TTL |
| Vector search latency | Sub-50ms | Index pruning per tenant |

## XII. KEY INVARIANTS & PRINCIPLES

1. **One Spine, Many Projections:** All UI surfaces are views of the same Spine. No duplication.
2. **Never Reason at Intake:** Loader never transforms data. Transformation paid once per entity.
3. **No Execution Without Approval:** Every action is governance-gated.
4. **Tenant Isolation:** Every query includes `tenant_id` scoping.
5. **Audit Everything:** All actions logged with actor, timestamp, reasoning, outcome.
6. **Cloud-First Memory:** No local agent state. All memory in cloud (D1/Supabase).
7. **Zero-Trust Routing:** Workers never exposed publicly. All traffic via Gateway.
8. **Continuous Learning:** Outcomes feed back into system memory for future signal generation.
