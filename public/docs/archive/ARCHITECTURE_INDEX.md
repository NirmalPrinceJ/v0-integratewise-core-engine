## 🎯 START HERE: One-Line Summary

**IntegrateWise is a three-spine unified intelligence operating system connecting fragmented enterprise tools into one coherent, governed, reasoning workspace.**

- **Three Spines:** Human (ground truth), AI (reasoning), Collaboration (joint decisions)
- **Unified Lifecycle:** INTAKE → PROMOTION → MEMORY → DECAY → CONTINUITY
- **Architecture:** 28 Cloudflare Workers orchestrating 4 apps, governed by a canonical Spine data model
- **Core Principle:** One Spine. Many projections. The Spine is the source of truth.

## 🔄 Three-Spine Lifecycle

All signals (human, AI, collaboration) flow through this unified 5-phase lifecycle:

```
1. INTAKE     → Signal enters the system
2. PROMOTION  → Validates, resolves, ready to act
3. MEMORY     → Stored as ground truth
4. DECAY      → Aged signals archived
5. CONTINUITY → Outcome stored for future learning
```

**For each spine:**

- **Human:** Goals, decisions, outcomes (L1 Workbench)
- **AI:** Reasoning traces, proposals, signals (L3 Twin)
- **Collaboration:** Approvals, feedback, compounded outcomes (L2 Overlay)

---

## 🔐 Key Invariants

These are non-negotiable principles embedded in the system:

1. **One Spine, Many Projections** - All UI surfaces are views of the same Spine
2. **Never Reason at Intake** - Loader never transforms. Transformation paid once per entity.
3. **No Execution Without Approval** - Every action is governance-gated
4. **Tenant Isolation** - Every query includes `tenant_id` scoping
5. **Audit Everything** - All actions logged with actor, timestamp, reasoning, outcome
6. **Cloud-First Memory** - No local agent state. All memory in cloud (D1/Supabase)
7. **Zero-Trust Routing** - Workers never exposed publicly. All traffic via Gateway
8. **Continuous Learning** - Outcomes feed back into system memory for future signals

---

## 🚀 Deployment Reference

**Environments:**

- `dev` → localhost:3333 (pnpm dev)
- `test` → staging.integratewise.ai
