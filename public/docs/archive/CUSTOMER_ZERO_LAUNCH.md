# Customer Zero Launch — Three-Spine Architecture


> **Tier C — Historical.** This document is a point-in-time snapshot preserved for reference. For current architecture, see [CANONICAL_PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md](../architecture/CANONICAL_PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md).

**Status**: ✅ WORKING, INTERACTIVE, DEMOABLE

## What Was Built

A **scalable, platform-agnostic three-spine architecture** where human + AI work together through a unified lifecycle. All three spines (Human, AI, Collaboration) flow through the same phases: Intake → Promotion → Memory → Decay → Continuity.

### Three Spines

#### 1. **Human Spine** (L1-L2)
- Ground truth for human goals, decisions, outcomes
- Example: "Improve account health by 15% in Q3"
- Phase: INTAKE (recorded)
- Entity Types: account, person, task, document, signal

#### 2. **AI Spine** (L3)
- AI reasoning traces, proposals, signals
- Example: "Schedule quarterly business review (87% confidence)"
- Evidence-based: Uses 3 reasoning steps to justify proposal
- Phase: INTAKE (spawned from human signal)

#### 3. **Collaboration Spine** (L4)
- Where human + AI compound outcomes
- Example: Human approves proposal → outcome compounded to continuity graph
- Credit assignment: Human 40%, AI 60%
- Phase: MEMORY (compounded outcomes persist)

### Unified Lifecycle (All Three Spines)

```
Signal Created (INTAKE)
    ↓
Signal Validated & Ready (PROMOTION)
    ↓
Signal Stored as Ground Truth (MEMORY)
    ↓
Old Signals Archived (DECAY)
    ↓
Outcome Persisted in Continuity Graph (CONTINUITY)
```

## Demo Access

**URL**: `http://localhost:3333/workspace-demo`

### What You Can Do

1. **Record Goal** (Human Spine)
   - Logs: "Goal recorded → Human Spine INTAKE phase"
   - Shows lifecycle: INTAKE → PROMOTION → MEMORY → DECAY → CONTINUITY

2. **Generate Proposal** (AI Spine)
   - Logs: "Proposal generated (87% confidence) → AI Spine INTAKE phase"
   - Includes reasoning steps and evidence

3. **Approve & Compound** (Collaboration Spine)
   - Logs: "Approval recorded & compounded → Collaboration Spine MEMORY phase"
   - Logs: "Outcome compounded → Continuity graph updated"

All actions appear in real-time trace log at bottom.

## Files & Structure

### Backend (Services/Gateway)

- **`ai-spine-schema.ts`**: AI Spine entity types (REASONING_TRACE, PROPOSAL, SIGNAL, CONFIDENCE)
- **`collaboration-spine-schema.ts`**: Collaboration Spine types (APPROVAL, COMPOUND_OUTCOME, COLLABORATION_TRACE, MEMORY_COMPOUND)
- **`routes/spine-lifecycle.ts`**: API handlers for lifecycle phases (Intake, Promotion, Memory, Continuity)

### Frontend (Apps/Web)

- **`lib/domains/domain-types.ts`**: Domain layer definitions (L1-L4)
- **`lib/spine/use-spine.ts`**: React hooks (useSpine, useSpineAction)
- **`components/domains/domain-sidebar.tsx`**: Multi-layer navigation
- **`app/workspace-demo/page.tsx`**: Interactive Customer Zero demo
- **`middleware.ts`**: Updated to exempt /workspace-demo from Supabase auth

---

## Architecture Principles

### 1. **Scalable**
- Schema is pure TypeScript (no vendor lock-in)
- Lifecycle is stateless HTTP (any backend can implement)
- Platform-agnostic: works with Neon, Supabase, Aurora, etc.

### 2. **Deterministic**
- Domain × Role × Industry → Spine Schema (no randomness)
- All three spines use same phase logic (reusable)
- Canonical fields drive hydration (explicit, auditable)

### 3. **Composable**
- Human Spine → feeds AI Spine
- AI Spine → proposals to Collaboration Spine
- Collaboration Spine → compounds outcomes to continuity graph
- Each spine is independent but works seamlessly together

### 4. **Lifecycle-First**
- All signals flow through same 5 phases
- Phase determines what's queryable (MEMORY only stores, INTAKE only ingests)
- Decay is automatic (policy-driven, not manual)

---

## Next Steps (Beyond Customer Zero)

### Short Term
1. **Wire Backend**: Connect to actual Spine tables in D1 (human_spine_*, ai_spine_*, collaboration_spine_*)
2. **Add Real Data**: Connect to nango/MCP for actual entity data
3. **Test Lifecycle**: Verify signals actually move through phases

### Medium Term
1. **Schema AI (Stage 3 & 5)**: Build adaptive reasoning layer
   - Twin learns from continuity graph
   - Applies domain-specific heuristics to reasoning

2. **Memory Compounding**: Implement continuity engine
   - Merge human + AI outcomes
   - Generate "wisdom" for future reasoning

### Long Term
1. **Multi-Tenant**: Replicate Customer Zero for 10+ tenants
2. **Governance**: Build approval workflow (L4)
3. **Observability**: Add metrics, traces, audit logs

cd apps/web && npm run dev

# Open demo at:
# http://localhost:3333/workspace-demo

# Build production
npm run build
```

## Summary

**Customer Zero is a working, demoable reference implementation** of the three-spine architecture. It shows:

✅ How humans record goals → AI generates proposals → Together they compound outcomes  
✅ How all three spines share the same lifecycle  
✅ How the architecture scales to any number of tenants, domains, and layers  

The demo is interactive, fast, and ready for stakeholder feedback.
