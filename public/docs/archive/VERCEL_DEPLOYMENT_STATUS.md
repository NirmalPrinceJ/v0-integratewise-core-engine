# IntegrateWise Vercel Deployment Status


> **Tier C — Historical.** This document is a point-in-time snapshot preserved for reference. For current architecture, see [CANONICAL_PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md](../architecture/CANONICAL_PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Current Status: DEPLOYED ✓

**Production URL**: https://web-arugyvamj-integratewises-projects.vercel.app  
**Alias**: https://web-two-chi-13.vercel.app  
**Demo Page**: `/public-demo` (working locally, gated on Vercel by project auth)

## What's Working

### Local Development (localhost:3333)
- Full app with all 63 routes compiled and optimized
- Public demo page at `/public-demo` - Shows three-spine architecture
- Layer switcher in sidebar (Human/AI/Collaborate/Approve buttons)
- Middleware properly handles missing Supabase config
- All pages render without 500 errors

### Vercel Production
- App deployed successfully
- 62 routes optimized and live
- Build passes with no errors
- Environment variables encrypted and stored
- Middleware deployed and active

## Three-Spine Architecture

**Human Spine (L1)** - Blue  
Ground truth for goals, decisions, outcomes

**AI Spine (L3)** - Purple  
Reasoning traces, proposals, signals with confidence

**Collaboration Spine (L2)** - Amber  
Joint approvals, memory compounding, outcomes

**Governance (L4)** - Green  
Approvals, compliance, audit trails

### Unified Lifecycle
All three spines flow through: **INTAKE → PROMOTION → MEMORY → DECAY → CONTINUITY**

## Deployment Details

**Backend**: Cloudflare Workers (Gateway, Spine, Twin, Governance)  
**Frontend**: Next.js 16 + React 19.2 on Vercel  
**Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (configured via env vars)  
**Auth**: Supabase native auth (currently using placeholder values)

## Known Issues & Fixes

### 500 Error (FIXED)
**Issue**: Middleware was throwing 500 errors when Supabase config was missing or incorrect  
**Fix**: Added graceful fallback - detects placeholder env vars and allows public routes without Supabase

### Vercel Project Auth Layer
**Issue**: Vercel project has team-level authentication enabled  
**Status**: Public demo page works locally but requires auth on Vercel  
**Solution**: Team member can disable authentication in Vercel dashboard project settings to make public routes accessible

## Environment Variables Required

Set in Vercel project settings (currently using placeholders):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://integratewise.vercel.app
```

## Next Steps

1. **Real Supabase Credentials**: Add actual Supabase project URL and API keys
2. **Test Auth Flow**: Verify Supabase authentication works end-to-end
3. **Wire Backend APIs**: Connect three-spine lifecycle to Cloudflare Workers
4. **Test Lifecycle Flow**: Verify Human Signal → AI Reasoning → Approval → Compound works
5. **Scale to Multiple Tenants**: Replicate Customer Zero pattern for production users

## Local Testing

```bash
cd /vercel/share/v0-project/apps/web
pnpm dev
# Visit http://localhost:3333/public-demo
```

## Production Access

Current: https://web-arugyvamj-integratewises-projects.vercel.app/public-demo  
(May be gated by Vercel project authentication)
