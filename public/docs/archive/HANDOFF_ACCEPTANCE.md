# Platform Handoff to Replit — Acceptance Criteria Met


> **Tier C — Historical.** This document is a point-in-time snapshot preserved for reference. For current architecture, see [CANONICAL_PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md](../architecture/CANONICAL_PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Plan Execution Summary

**Objective:** Clean v0 experimental files, verify backend contract, hand FE to Replit for universal app build.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria — ALL MET

#### 1. TypeScript Clean (0 errors)
- Web app: `npx tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors ✅
- No TS errors blocking build or deployment ✅

#### 2. No Orphaned Imports
- `entity-stretch.tsx`: Already deleted ✅
- `customer-zero-workspace.tsx`: Already deleted ✅
- No broken imports remaining ✅

#### 3. Backend Contract Verified
| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Auth quarantine (password auth gated) | ✅ `ALLOW_PASSWORD_AUTH` env check |
| Gateway service bindings (9 services) | ✅ intelligence, connector, knowledge, etc. |
| Twin model route (`/v1/chat/completions`) | ✅ Routes to OpenRouter |
| Knowledge queue + cron | ✅ Configured in wrangler.toml |

#### 4. Real Customer Zero Infra Untouched
- `components/l1/admin/customer-zero-verification.tsx` | ✅ Intact
- `utils/spine/client.ts` seeded with tenant `iw-customer-zero` | ✅ 10 references
- Admin panel wired | ✅ Ready for Replit UI layer

#### 5. v0 Founder Ops (Metrics.tsx) Maintained
- Route: `/metrics` | ✅ Functional
- Based on real admin endpoints | ✅ Data-grounded
- Flagged for Replit reconciliation if equivalent built | ✅ No collision

### Frontend State

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Routes | ✅ 9 routes wired | /, /app/*, /auth/callback, /oauth/callback/:provider, /dev/unified/*, /metrics, /dashboard, * |
| Core L1 domains | ✅ Present | account-success, bizops, workspace, customer-zero, etc. |
| L2 overlay | ✅ Present | admin panels, intelligence overlay |
| Shell/Layout | ✅ Present | AppShell, auth gate, projections |
| Twin UI | ✅ Present | my-desk, twin-workbench, handoff flows |
| Real Customer Zero | ✅ Intact | customer-zero-verification wired + seeded |

### Backend Services

| Service | Deployed | Route | Status |
|---------|----------|-------|--------|
| Gateway | ✅ | `/v1/*` | Single ingress, 9 bindings |
| Intelligence (Twin) | ✅ | `/v1/chat/completions` | gpt-5-mini reasoning |
| Connector | ✅ | `/v1/connector/*` | Nango OAuth + tool sync |
| Knowledge | ✅ | `/v1/knowledge/*` | Memory lifecycle |
| Pipeline | ✅ | Internal queue | Normalizer + Spine publisher |
| Loader | ✅ | Webhook ingress | Nango auth.created handler |

### Build & Deployment

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Vite build | ✅ 8.9 MB dist/ |
| Assets chunking | ⚠️ Chunks >500KB (consider dynamic imports for Replit) |
| vercel.json | ✅ SPA routing configured |
| pnpm-lock.yaml | ✅ Reproducible builds |
| Environment variables | ✅ Placeholder in vercel.json |

## Handoff Deliverables

### v0 Maintains
- Backend services (all 6 core + infrastructure)
- Schema hydration pipeline
- Audit trails + governance
- Documentation (REGISTRY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, architecture guides)
- Admin verification endpoint
- Founder ops dashboard (`/metrics`)

### Replit Owns
- Universal shell & navigation
- Multi-department L1 projections
- L2 embedding layer
- Customer-facing UI
- Mobile & desktop apps
- Landing page marketing site

### Shared Resources (Do Not Modify)
- `utils/spine/client.ts` (seeded with iw-customer-zero)
- `components/l1/admin/customer-zero-verification.tsx`
- Gateway service bindings
- Backend routes (`/v1/*`)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Replit:** Clone this repo and build universal FE (iwa-customer-zero monorepo)
2. **v0:** Monitor for issues; maintain backend contract
3. **Joint:** Verify end-to-end flow (landing → auth → workspace → approval → continuity)

---

## Sign-Off

- ✅ TypeScript clean
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Backend contract verified
- ✅ Real infra intact
- ✅ v0 experimental code removed
- ✅ Deployment ready

**Platform is clean and ready for Replit's universal FE build.**
