## Executive Summary

The deployed `IntegrateWise Operating System` app was successfully recovered from the source repository and restored to `apps/web`. This was a **Next.js 16 + React 19** application that existed separately during the Dec 14 - Jan 15 period, then was consolidated into this monorepo during the June 23-24 code excavation.

**What Happened:**
1. **Dec 14 - Jan 15:** Deployed app lived in separate repo (`integratewise/integratewise-ai-workspace@consolidation/monorepo-v11-features`)
2. **Jun 23-24:** Code consolidation into main repo (branch merges, v0 work, Replit handoff)
3. **Jun 25:** Deployed app source recovered and restored to `apps/web`

## What Was Lost & How It Was Recovered

### Loss Timeline
1. **Source Location:** `integratewise/integratewise-ai-workspace@consolidation/monorepo-v11-features`
2. **Why Lost:** During branch consolidation, the deployed code wasn't in the main GitHub repo history visible here
3. **Where It Was:** In separate organization (integratewise) under integratewize account

### Recovery Method
1. Extracted from deployed URL metadata
2. Located source branch in separate repo
3. Copied entire `apps/integrationwise-os/` directory
4. Restored to `apps/web/` in main repo
5. Commit message documents the recovery
6. Created recovery branch for tracking

### Current State
- ✅ **Code is recovered and in repo**
- ✅ **Recovery branch created:** `recovery/integratewise-os-deployed`
- ✅ **Full structure intact:** 56 routes, 16 components, 25 lib utils
- ⚠️ **Build needs fixes:** 13 errors require component additions
- ⚠️ **Route conflicts:** Need de-duplication

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Fix Build)
1. Add missing shadcn/ui components via CLI
2. Resolve route conflicts (consolidate duplicate /today routes)
3. Verify all imports resolve
4. Test build locally
5. Push to production branch

### Short Term (Verify Deployment)
1. Deploy to Vercel via `recovery/integratewise-os-deployed` branch
2. Test production URL
3. Verify API connections to backend services
4. Test auth flow

### Medium Term (Integration)
1. Wire frontend to real backend APIs
2. Test M3 data integration paths
3. Implement platform JWT/OAuth
4. Set up monitoring & observability
