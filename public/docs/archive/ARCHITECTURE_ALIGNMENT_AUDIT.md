## Detailed Layer Analysis

### L0: Onboarding Layer (25% Complete) 🔴

#### Required by AGENTS.md
```
Stage 1: Entry + AI Insights (0-15 sec)
  └─ Name + DOB input
  └─ AI personality analysis
  └─ Working style predictions
  └─ First "wow moment"

Stage 2: AI Loader Demo (15-30 sec)
  └─ Natural language input demo
  └─ AI transforms to structured actions
  └─ 4 tools simultaneously
  └─ Second "wow moment"

Stage 3: Context Selection (30-50 sec)
  └─ Productivity Hub (OS) path
  └─ CS Platform path
  └─ Signup (Google OAuth / email)

Stage 4: Tool Connect + First Hydration (50-120 sec)
  └─ Connect 1-2 tools via OAuth
  └─ Upload data dump (CSV/JSON/PDF)
  └─ Backfill sync through 8-stage pipeline
  └─ Onboarding Accelerator bootstraps
```

#### Current Implementation
```
LoginPage
  └─ Email/password form
  └─ OAuth buttons (Google, GitHub, Microsoft)
  └─ Link to marketing site
```

#### Gaps
| Required | Missing |
|----------|---------|
| AI personality insights | ❌ Not implemented |
| Natural language demo | ❌ Not implemented |
| Context selection (Productivity Hub vs CS) | ❌ Not implemented |
| Tool connection wizard | ❌ Not implemented |
| Data upload & hydration | ❌ Not implemented |
| Progress indicator | ❌ Not implemented |

**Figma Decision:** Design 4-screen onboarding flow with:
1. **Screen 1:** Personality analyzer (name, DOB, AI insights card)
2. **Screen 2:** Live demo (split screen: natural language input → 4 tool outputs)
3. **Screen 3:** Context picker (two cards: "Productivity Hub" vs "CS Platform")
4. **Screen 4:** Tool connector (drag-drop OAuth + file upload with progress)

## Figma UI Decisions

### Decision 1: Navigation Structure
```
Sidebar (collapsible sections):
  
  HOME
  ├── Dashboard (Home)
  
  RELATIONSHIPS
  ├── Accounts
  ├── Contacts
  
  WORK
  ├── Projects
  ├── Pipeline
  ├── Tasks
  ├── Calendar
  ├── Meetings
  
  KNOWLEDGE
  ├── Docs
  ├── Notes
  ├── Knowledge Space
  
  TEAM
  ├── Team
  ├── Analytics
  
  INTELLIGENCE
  ├── Risks
  ├── Expansion
  
  SYSTEM
  └── Settings
```

### Decision 2: L2 Component Layouts
```
1. SpineUI: Full-width data table with filters
   - Columns: Entity | Type | Health | Status | Last Updated
   - Actions: View 360°, Edit, Archive

2. ContextUI: Split-pane viewer
   - Left: Document tree
   - Right: Content preview with entity highlights

3. KnowledgeUI: Graph visualization
   - Nodes: Entities, docs, insights
   - Edges: Relationships
   - Filters: By type, date, confidence

4. EvidencePanel: Side drawer
   - Trigger: "Why this signal?" button
   - Content: Source data, calculations, confidence score

5. DigitalTwin: Full-screen modal
   - Sandbox environment
   - "What-if" scenario testing
   - Safe experimentation space
```

### Decision 3: Domain Views in Home
```
Home dashboard has 12 domain toggle buttons:
  [CS] [Sales] [RevOps] [Marketing] [Product] [Finance]
  [Service] [Procurement] [IT] [Education] [Personal] [BizOps]

Each shows domain-specific metrics:
  - CS: Health scores, renewal risk
  - Sales: Pipeline, deals at risk
  - RevOps: Attribution, forecast
  - etc.
```

### Phase 4: Integration (Ongoing)
1. Wire all L2 components to L3 APIs
2. Ensure all L1 modules use correct hooks
3. Implement full L0→L1 transition
4. Add navigation between all modules

## Summary

**Current State:** 65% aligned with AGENTS.md architecture
- L0: 25% (missing 3 onboarding stages)
- L1: 40% (missing 9 modules)
- L2: 36% (missing 9 components)
- L3: 100% (complete)

**To Reach 100%:**
- Build 4 onboarding screens
- Build 9 app pages
- Build 9 L2 components
- Wire everything together

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks for full alignment
