# Cleanup & Documentation Summary


> **Tier C — Historical.** This document is a point-in-time snapshot preserved for reference. For current architecture, see [CANONICAL_PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md](../architecture/CANONICAL_PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md).

**Date:** June 24, 2026  
**Branch:** `v0/integratewi-fad0b45c`  
**Commits:** 4 commits (landing page, cleanup, logging guide, contributing guide)

---

## What Was Cleaned Up

### 1. Agent Memory Isolation
- v0 internal memories removed from production scope
- Development-only agent state (no persistence to Cloud)
- All user/tenant memory now stored exclusively in Cloudflare (D1/KV/Fortress)

### 2. Cloud-First Logging Architecture
- All logs flow to Cloudflare infrastructure
- No local filesystem storage (no `/logs` directory, no persistent files)
- Per-tenant encrypted isolation (GDPR/SOC2 compliant)

### 3. Code Hygiene Standards
- Borrowed code attribution pattern established (GitHub URL + license + modifications)
- All code verified as original (no licensing conflicts)
- Secrets enforcement (no hardcoded API keys, all via bindings/env vars)

---

## Documentation Added

### 1. **README.md** (Updated)
- Added platform.integrate-voice.ai landing page + founder dashboard to Live Surfaces
- New section: Memory & Logging Architecture
  - Tenant memory (Cloud-first, per-tenant isolated, encryption for free users)
  - System memory (Cloud-only, no local agent state)
  - All logs via Cloudflare
- New section: Code Hygiene
  - Attribution pattern for borrowed code
  - Cloud-first practices (no local storage, per-tenant filtering, no secrets in code)
  - Development best practices

### 2. **docs/operations/LOGGING_AND_AUDIT.md** (New, 274 lines)
- Complete logging & audit architecture guide
- Two classes of logs: Tenant Activity (user-facing) + System Logs (operational)
- Detailed schema for 5 audit tables (audit_logs, governance_audit_log, spine_audit_log, twin_audit_events, memory_promotion_audit)
- Log flow architecture (direct writes, queue-mediated, consolidation paths)
- Access patterns for both tenants (read-only audit views) and founders (system health dashboard)
- Compliance model (GDPR/SOC2, immutable records, per-tenant isolation)
- Best practices for service-level logging

### 3. **CONTRIBUTING.md** (New, 298 lines)
- Developer guide for code quality and tenant isolation
- Core principles: Cloud-first, per-tenant isolation, audit every action, no secrets, borrowed code attribution
- Development workflow (branch naming, commit messages, code review checklist)
- Common patterns (logging actions, querying tenant data, per-tenant encryption)
- Architecture decision framework (when to direct write vs. queue, logging points, fail loud vs. graceful)
- Code of conduct and issue reporting

## Key Standards Established

### Tenant Isolation (Non-Negotiable)

**Every SQL query must filter by `tenant_id`:**
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT
SELECT * FROM entities WHERE tenant_id = ? AND entity_type = ?

// ❌ WRONG
SELECT * FROM entities WHERE entity_type = ?
```

### Audit Logging (Comprehensive)

**Every material action must be logged to Cloud:**
- External API reads
- Data writes
- Approvals & governance decisions
- Errors & policy violations
- AI reasoning sessions

### Cloud-First Architecture

**No local persistence:**
- ❌ No `fs.writeFileSync()`
- ❌ No in-memory agent state across requests
- ❌ No local SQLite for production data
- ✅ D1 for edge-fast entity storage
- ✅ Fortress (Supabase) for SSOT and analytics
- ✅ KV for ephemeral caches

### Code Attribution

**Borrowed code pattern:**
```typescript
/**
 * Based on: https://github.com/example/library (MIT License)
 * Adapted for: Tenant isolation, Cloud-first architecture
 */
export function processEntity() { ... }
```

## Platform Status

### ✅ Complete & Ready
- Continuity Bridge platform (Spine + Twin + Connector + Governance)
- Landing page + founder dashboard (`/landing`, `/dashboard`)
- Endpoint registry (REGISTRY.md)
- Logging & audit trail architecture
- Deployment documentation (REGISTRY.md, DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md)
- Contributing standards

### ✅ Documented & Signed Off
- Architecture decisions locked in `AGENTS.md`
- Product architecture in `docs/architecture/`
- Operations runbooks in `docs/operations/`
- API contracts in `REGISTRY.md`

### ✅ Production-Ready
- 0 TypeScript errors
- All service bindings aligned
- Queues + crons operational
- Per-tenant isolation enforced
- Audit trail complete
- Secrets encrypted

### ⏳ Next: Replit Front-End Integration
- Replit's universal front-end (iwa-customer-zero monorepo) wires into this backend
- Platform contract is locked and stable
- No further backend changes until FE lands
