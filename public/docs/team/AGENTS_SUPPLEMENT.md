## 1. Executive Summary

IntegrateWise is a **Universal Cognitive Operating System** — an AI-powered Knowledge Workspace that fundamentally changes how organizations work with their tools, data, and AI.

**Core Philosophy**: _"AI That Thinks in Context, Waits for Approvals"_

**Tagline**: _Normalize Once, Render Anywhere | Enhance, Don't Replace_

**The Differentiator**: First application since 1945 to complete the full loop of **human approval and post-approval agent execution with audit rails and evidence backing**.

---

## 2. The Core Loop

```
LOAD → NORMALIZE → STORE → THINK → REVIEW & APPROVE → ACT → REPEAT
```

The **REVIEW & APPROVE** (Govern) stage is a **hard gate**. Nothing executes without:

- Human approval
- Audit trail
- Evidence backing

This is what makes IntegrateWise fundamentally different from every AI-native tool on the market.

## 3. Four-Layer Architecture (L0–L3)

| Layer  | Name                      | Purpose                                                               | Key Components                                                                                                                           |
| ------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **L0** | Onboarding                | Signup, context questions, tool connect, first data hydration         | 4 stages: Entry + AI Insights → AI Loader Demo → Context Selection → Tool Connect + First Hydration                                      |
| **L1** | Context-Aware Workspace   | 15 modules rendering context-specific views of normalized data        | Home, Projects, Accounts, Contacts, Meetings, Docs, Tasks, Calendar, Notes, Knowledge Space, Team, Pipeline, Risks, Expansion, Analytics |
| **L2** | Universal Cognitive Layer | 14 cognitive components for reasoning, action, and governance         | SpineUI, ContextUI, KnowledgeUI, Evidence, Signals, Think, Act, HITL, Govern, Adjust, Repeat, AuditUI, AgentConfig, DigitalTwin          |
| **L3** | Universal Backend         | The engine: 8-stage mandatory pipeline, 4 accelerators, 6 data stores | Pipeline stages, accelerators, stores, engines, dual-loop architecture, security model                                                   |

**Critical Rule**: Every piece of data must flow through L3 before reaching L1 or L2. There are no shortcuts.

## 7. L3: Universal Backend Engine

### 7.1 Three Data Ingestion Planes

| Plane                                 | Data Type                                                    | Ingestion Path                                                    | Storage                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Plane 1: Structured (Tool Data)**   | CRM deals, support tickets, billing events, calendar entries | Webhooks/Polling → Connector Service → 8-Stage Pipeline           | Spine (Neon PostgreSQL)       |
| **Plane 2: Unstructured (Documents)** | PDFs, CSVs, spreadsheets, emails, images                     | Upload/Watch → R2 raw storage → Knowledge Service → Chunk + Embed | Context Store (pgvector + R2) |
| **Plane 3: AI Chats (MCP Sessions)**  | Conversations from Claude, ChatGPT, other AI providers       | MCP Connectors → Session Summarization → Compress at Source       | AI Chats Store                |

### 7.2 Eight-Stage Mandatory Pipeline

Every piece of data — regardless of source, type, or urgency — must pass through all 8 stages. There are no shortcuts.

| Stage | Name            | Processing                                                                                                                                                             | Failure Mode                                   |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | **Analyzer**    | Source detection, object type identification, metadata extraction, schema version check. Stamps payload with pipeline_id for traceability.                             | Unknown source or malformed payload → DLQ      |
| 2     | **Classifier**  | Category mapping to internal taxonomy, CTX enum assignment, priority scoring (critical/normal/batch), accelerator routing flags.                                       | Unmappable object type → DLQ                   |
| 3     | **Filter**      | Tenant-level and user-level data scope enforcement. Checks data against scope definitions set during L0 onboarding. PII detection flags.                               | Scope rule error → pass-through with warning   |
| 4     | **Refiner**     | Field-level transformations: date normalization (ISO 8601 UTC), currency conversion, text cleaning (HTML strip), entity resolution across tools.                       | Schema mapping failure → DLQ                   |
| 5     | **Extractor**   | Relationship extraction (account→contacts, deal→line items), computed fields (deal velocity, sentiment), change delta calculation, embedding generation for documents. | Extraction failure → DLQ with partial results  |
| 6     | **Validator**   | Data integrity checks, deduplication (exact + fuzzy), business rule validation, cross-reference verification against existing Spine records.                           | Integrity violation → DLQ                      |
| 7     | **Sanity Scan** | AI-powered anomaly detection, outlier identification, test data detection. Uses rules + ML to quarantine suspicious data before it enters stores.                      | Anomaly detected → Quarantine for human review |
| 8     | **Sectorizer**  | Final routing to appropriate stores (Spine, Context, AI Chats). Performs the dual-write. Emits events to Think Engine and triggers Accelerator recalculation.          | Write failure → retry queue with backoff       |

### 7.3 Four Accelerator Systems

| Accelerator                   | Purpose                                                                                                                                 | Key Components                                                                                                        |

| **Context Store**           | pgvector on Neon + R2      | Embeddings, document chunks, and metadata for unstructured content. Enables semantic search. | Write via Pipeline; read via Knowledge components  |
| **AI Chats Store**          | Neon PostgreSQL            | Summarized AI chat sessions. Never stores full transcripts — only compressed summaries.      | Write via MCP Connectors; read via KnowledgeUI     |
| **Audit Store**             | Neon (append-only)         | Immutable log of every action, approval, data change, and system event.                      | Write-only from all services; read via AuditUI     |
| **Hot Memory**              | Cloudflare Durable Objects | Real-time state for active sessions, collaboration, and in-flight computations.              | Read/write by Workers; auto-evicts to cold storage |

## 8. AI Agent System

**Only One Cognitive Twin**

The system operates with a single Cognitive Twin per tenant/workspace, not multiple specialized agents. This twin:

- Maintains continuity across all interactions
- Learns from all approved/rejected actions
- Operates across all three data planes
- Enforces governance policies uniformly

**Key Principles**:

- Approval-only execution: Every agent proposal passes through the HITL gate
- The Think Engine generates situations and proposed actions
- The Govern layer enforces policy compliance
- The HITL component presents proposals to the human approver
- Only after explicit approval does the Act Engine execute
- The Adjust component captures the approval or rejection to improve future proposals

---

## 9. Dual-Loop Architecture

IntegrateWise operates two reinforcing feedback loops that converge to create a self-improving system.

### 9.1 Loop A: Context-to-Truth (Human-Governed)

```
Context → Brainstorming → Action → Tool Write → Ingest → Normalize → Truth → View → Repeat
```

Captures human intelligence from governed channels (Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram, Custom GPTs) and converts it into executable actions.

**Critical Rule**: Brainstorming NEVER becomes truth directly. Truth is only created when an action writes to a tool, and the ingestion pipeline confirms and normalizes it.

### 9.2 Loop B: Tool-to-Truth (System-Governed)

```
Loader → 8-Stage Pipeline → Store (Spine) → Think Engine → Act Engine → Tool Write-Back → Repeat
```

Processes structured tool data through the continuous intelligence cycle.

### 9.3 Convergence

- Loop A feeds Loop B through tools: human decisions result in tool updates, which Loop B ingests and normalizes
- Loop A triggers change; Loop B confirms truth
- Both converge into the Think Engine's views
- Both repeat continuously
- The convergence point is the **Spine**, where all validated truth resides regardless of origin

## 13. Growth-Aligned Data Model

IntegrateWise does not just track data — it tracks growth. Every record, metric, and signal is linked to organizational goals.

| Dimension      | Traditional Systems                                   | IntegrateWise                                                                          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Model** | Static records: "We have 100 accounts with $850k ARR" | Active, goal-linked: "100 accounts at 85% of $1M goal, $150k gap, Acme at MEDIUM RISK" |
| **View**       | Reactive — "What happened?"                           | Proactive, risk-aware — "What should I do to hit my goals?"                            |
| **Action**     | Manual — human interprets and decides                 | Suggested, evidence-based — AI proposes, human approves                                |
| **Learning**   | None — same static view regardless of outcomes        | Continuous — every approval/rejection improves future proposals                        |
| **Alignment**  | Data disconnected from goals                          | Every metric is a percentage of a goal, with risk scoring and gap analysis             |

## 14. Unique Architectural Combination

IntegrateWise combines eight architectural elements that no single competitor has brought together:

| Element                         | Exists Elsewhere?     | IntegrateWise                               |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| L0–L3 Cognitive Architecture    | No                    | ✓ Full 4-layer cognitive system             |
| MCP-Native (AI Tool Discovery)  | Anthropic only        | ✓ Integrated for AI session capture         |
| Dual-Write (Truth + Context)    | No                    | ✓ Spine + Context Store parallel writes     |
| Preserved Work Layer            | Traditional apps only | ✓ Enhance, don't replace existing workflows |
| Approval-Only Agents            | No                    | ✓ Hard HITL gate before every action        |
| Edge Correction (Self-Learning) | Research papers only  | ✓ Adjust + Repeat components in production  |
| Growth-Aligned Schema           | BI tools (static)     | ✓ Active, goal-linked at database level     |
| Continuous Learning Loop        | No                    | ✓ Dual-loop with convergence at Spine       |

**No competitor has more than 2–3 of these elements. IntegrateWise has all eight, working together.**

### 15.2 Key Principles for Agents

1. **No shortcuts through the pipeline** — All data must flow through all 8 stages
2. **HITL is mandatory** — No AI action executes without human approval
3. **Dual-write to Spine + Context** — Every normalized record writes to both stores
4. **Evidence for every claim** — All signals and recommendations must have provenance
5. **Tenant isolation is absolute** — Every query must include tenant_id scoping
6. **Audit everything** — Every action, approval, and data change is logged
7. **Normalize once, render anywhere** — Canonical schemas are the source of truth
8. **Growth-aligned by default** — All metrics link to goals

### 15.3 Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all pipeline stages
- Integration tests for connector OAuth flows
- End-to-end tests for approval workflows
- Load tests for pipeline throughput (target: 10k events/minute)
- Security tests for RLS policies
- Chaos tests for DLQ recovery

### 15.4 Secrets Management (Doppler)

**NO LOCAL .ENV FILES.** All secrets are managed through Doppler.

**Required Doppler Secrets:**

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL          # Supabase project URL
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY     # Supabase anonymous key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY       # Service role key (backend only)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY         # AI inference API key
N8N_WEBHOOK_SECRET         # n8n workflow auth
```

**Development Workflow:**

```bash
# Login to Doppler
doppler login

# Setup project
doppler setup

# Run dev server with Doppler
doppler run -- npm run dev

# Build with Doppler
doppler run -- npm run build
```

**Environment Structure:**

- `dev` — Local development
- `staging` — Pre-production testing
- `prod` — Production environment

**Security Rules:**

1. Never commit secrets to git
2. Never share service keys in Slack/email
3. Rotate keys quarterly via Doppler
4. Use separate projects for dev/staging/prod
