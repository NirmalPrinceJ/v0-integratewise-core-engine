Agreed. Add this as the appendix.

Appendix A — Code Map

This appendix maps the canonical data flow to the main implementation files so engineers can trace behavior in code.

1. Onboarding and tenant schema resolution

Column 1 Column 2
Responsibility File / Area
L0 onboarding flow and tenant activation apps/web/src/components/onboarding/
Tenant schema resolution packages/types/src/adaptive-schema.ts
Tenant runtime configuration tenant_spine_config usage across workflow / onboarding services

What to trace

- how department + industry resolve the tenant schema
- how onboarding completion unlocks workspace readiness
- how connector setup is tied to tenant context

---

2. Connector auth and sync kickoff

Column 1 Column 2
Responsibility File / Area
Connector auth and sync production services/connector/src/sync-producer.ts
Connector-specific handlers services/loader/src/handlers/

What to trace

- connector installation binding to tenant
- creamy / needed / delta sync behavior
- initial queue dispatch after auth success

---

3. Structured data flow (Flow A)

Column 1 Column 2
Responsibility File / Area
Structured ingestion handlers services/loader/src/handlers/hubspot.ts, salesforce.ts, etc.
Canonical field mapping services/loader/src/pipeline-stages.ts
Pipeline orchestration services/loader/src/pipeline.ts
8-stage normalization services/normalizer/src/index.ts
Spine write routing services/spine-v2/src/index.ts

What to trace

- raw webhook / poll payload enters loader
- payload goes through canonical mapping
- run8StagePipeline() executes
- normalized entity is routed to the correct Spine table
- resulting truth becomes available to workspace and cognitive layers

---

4. The 8-stage pipeline

Column 1 Column 2 Column 3
Stage Meaning Main file
Analyze inspect raw payload services/normalizer/src/index.ts
Classify determine entity / flow services/normalizer/src/index.ts
Filter tenant/schema filtering services/normalizer/src/index.ts
Refine normalize field shapes services/normalizer/src/index.ts
Extract pull canonical entity data services/normalizer/src/index.ts
Validate schema + required field checks services/normalizer/src/index.ts
Sanity business/data integrity checks services/normalizer/src/index.ts
Sectorize final destination routing services/normalizer/src/index.ts, services/spine-v2/src/index.ts

Developer note
This is the mandatory path for truth creation. No connector should bypass it.

---

5. Spine / SSOT routing

Column 1 Column 2
Responsibility File / Area
Entity type to table routing services/spine-v2/src/index.ts
Canonical truth persistence services/spine-v2/src/index.ts

What to trace

- ENTITY_TYPE_TO_TABLE
- destination table resolution
- structured truth writes
- prevention of non-canonical write paths

---

6. Unstructured content flow (Flow B)

Column 1 Column 2
Responsibility File / Area
Chunking services/knowledge/src/chunking/
Embeddings services/knowledge/src/embedding/
Knowledge ingestion services/knowledge/src/
Entity linking / metadata projection knowledge + Spine-linked context paths

What to trace

- file or content enters ingest
- text extraction / chunking happens
- embeddings are created
- searchable content lands in Knowledge
- linked metadata / references are attached to Spine entities

Rule reminder
Flow B enriches context and evidence. It does not replace structured truth.

---

7. Entity 360 read model

Column 1 Column 2
Responsibility File / Area
Read-time fusion services/workflow/src/views.ts
Workspace transforms services/workflow/src/transformers/

What to trace

- Spine truth fetch
- Knowledge/context fetch
- signal fetch
- fusion into a read model for workspace and cognitive use

Rule reminder
Entity 360 is read-only fusion, not a write surface.

---

8. Cognitive loop

Column 1 Column 2
Responsibility File / Area
Proposal generation / reasoning services/think/src/
Policy and approval rules services/govern/src/
Action execution services/act/src/

What to trace

- Think creates grounded proposals
- Govern evaluates policy
- approval token / approval state is enforced
- Act only runs after approval
- outcome is returned for re-ingestion

---

9. Flow C (AI sessions, MCP, governed AI memory)

Column 1 Column 2
Responsibility File / Area
MCP ingress services/mcp-connector/src/
AI reasoning / triage patterns services/think/src/
Governed proposal path services/govern/src/, services/act/src/

What to trace

- AI session capture
- proposal creation instead of direct truth write
- user review / governance path
- approved action execution
- result re-enters normal pipeline path

Rule reminder
Flow C never writes directly to Spine truth.

---

10. Approval and action

Column 1 Column 2
Responsibility File / Area
Approval policy enforcement services/govern/src/index.ts, services/govern/src/policies.ts
Action execution logic services/act/src/index.ts, services/act/src/lib/execution.ts

What to trace

- approval requirement checks
- x-approval-token validation
- connector execution
- auditability of action path

---

11. Re-ingestion after action

Column 1 Column 2
Responsibility File / Area
Action result queue-back services/act/src/index.ts
Pipeline re-entry pipeline queue consumers

What to trace

- approved action executes externally
- result is not trusted as final truth immediately
- result is queued back into pipeline
- Spine is refreshed through the same canonical path

Rule reminder
Truth must be refreshed through re-ingestion, not assumed from outbound execution alone.

---

12. Quick trace path for developers

Use this sequence when debugging any end-to-end issue:

1. apps/web/... — where the user initiated the action
2. services/gateway/... — how the request was routed
3. services/connector/... or services/loader/... — how source data entered
4. services/normalizer/... — how it was normalized
5. services/spine-v2/... — where truth was written
6. services/workflow/... — how it appeared in workspace / Entity 360
7. services/think/... — how intelligence was generated
8. services/govern/... — how approval policy was checked
9. services/act/... — how action executed
10. queue / pipeline path again — how result re-entered truth

---

13. One-line developer rule

If you cannot point to the ingest path, the pipeline path, the Spine write path, and the re-ingestion path, the feature is not fully wired.

If you want, I can also merge this directly into the KT note and produce a final KT v1.0 document in one piece.

The 12 departments part is correct, but the entity counts in your table do not match the live DOMAIN_SPINE_CONFIG arrays exactly. The schema file confirms the 12 active department configs, but several of the counts shown here are lower than what is currently defined in packages/types/src/schema.ts.

What is safe to state canonically

Use this wording instead:

12 Departments Active

Total: 12 primary runtime department configs are defined in packages/types/src/schema.ts under DOMAIN_SPINE_CONFIG. Each department defines its own:

- entity types — what records are allowed in the Spine path
- priority fields — what fields the pipeline prioritizes during extraction
- organic capabilities — what the BFF/UI exposes instead of raw entity types
- workspace emphasis — what modules and views are emphasized in L1
- cognitive relevance — what signals and reasoning patterns become meaningful in L2

Active department configs

1. CUSTOMER_SUCCESS
2. REVOPS
3. SALES
4. MARKETING
5. PRODUCT_ENGINEERING
6. FINANCE
7. SERVICE
8. PROCUREMENT
9. IT_ADMIN
10. STUDENT_TEACHER
11. BIZOPS
12. PERSONAL

Important runtime note

Department selection is not cosmetic. It determines:

- which entity_types are allowed by schema
- which fields are prioritized in extraction
- which organic capabilities appear in the UI
- which workspace modules are emphasized
- which signals and reasoning paths become active downstream

Also add this note

Some tenant-facing department labels resolve into shared base configs through DEPARTMENT_TO_CONFIG_KEY, for example:

- SUPPORT → SERVICE
- ENGINEERING → PRODUCT_ENGINEERING
- PRODUCT → PRODUCT_ENGINEERING
- LEGAL → BIZOPS
- HR → BIZOPS
- SUPPLY_CHAIN → PROCUREMENT
- SERVICE_OPS → SERVICE

Best KT-safe replacement for your last paragraph

Each department has its own schema-driven runtime behavior: allowed entity types, priority fields, organic capability mapping, workspace emphasis, and downstream cognitive relevance. These are defined in packages/types/src/schema.ts through DOMAIN_SPINE_CONFIG, DEPARTMENT_TO_CONFIG_KEY, and ORGANIC_CAPABILITY_MAP.
