Below is full, ready-to-use content for the **app landing page**, written for a RevOps / CS Ops–leaning technical buyer who already saw the marketing site and now wants depth. You can drop this into your app landing app as is and then trim/edit. [flow-agency](https://www.flow-agency.com/blog/b2b-saas-landing-page-best-practices/)

## 1. Hero: What the app actually is

**Headline**  
The Spine-powered workspace your RevOps and CS teams actually work in every day. [upfrontoperations](https://www.upfrontoperations.com/blog/revops-tech-stack)

**Subheading**  
IntegrateWise is a governed knowledge workspace built on the Spine — a unified intelligence layer that connects your CRM, CS tools, billing, support, and product analytics into one continuously updated view of every customer. Instead of pushing reports from a BI tool, it becomes the place where RevOps and CS ops define the truth, codify playbooks, and ship actions back into the stack. [upfrontoperations](https://www.upfrontoperations.com/blog/how-to-build-a-revops-tech-stack)

**Key points (bullets)**

- **One workspace:** Accounts, health, risks, and playbooks in a single UI, not 7 dashboards. [itbrief.com](https://itbrief.com.au/story/stack-overflow-launches-stack-internal-to-unify-workplace-knowledge)
- **Spine-backed truth:** Every card and signal in the workspace is backed by the Spine’s canonical data model and lineage, not an ad-hoc join. [pretius](https://pretius.com/blog/ai-knowledge-base-how-to-unify-company-information)
- **Governed actions:** AI only writes back to Salesforce/HubSpot, ticketing, or email when an explicit approval path is satisfied. [pretius](https://pretius.com/blog/ai-knowledge-base-how-to-unify-company-information)

Primary CTA: “See the Spine Workspace”  
Secondary CTA: “View architecture” (jumps to architecture section).

## 2. Product surface: How operators use it

This section describes **what the workspace feels like** for RevOps/CS ops and CSMs.

**Workspace overview**  
Inside IntegrateWise, your team works in a Spine-backed workspace, not a static dashboard. At the top level you see an entity-centric view: Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities, Subscriptions, Tickets, and custom entities pulled live from your stack. [everafter](https://www.everafter.ai/blog/best-customer-facing-workspace-tools-b2b-saas-2026)

Core modules:

- **Entity 360:** A longitudinal view of each account, combining CRM, billing, support, product usage, and notes into one timeline and one schema. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-knowledgebase-architecture-design-center-assem-hijazi-naxaf)
- **Signals & Risks:** A stream of Spine-generated signals — churn risks, expansion opportunities, SLA breaches — each with underlying evidence linked back to source tools. [itbrief.com](https://itbrief.com.au/story/stack-overflow-launches-stack-internal-to-unify-workplace-knowledge)
- **Playbooks:** Approved sequences of actions (emails, tasks, workflows) that the Spine recommends and the workspace executes with one click, via your existing tools. [wizr](https://wizr.ai/blog/generative-ai-in-b2b-saas/)
- **Approvals:** A control panel where RevOps/CS ops review and approve writebacks, automation, and AI-generated actions before they hit production systems. [pretius](https://pretius.com/blog/ai-knowledge-base-how-to-unify-company-information)

Example: a CSM opens an Account in Entity 360, sees a Spine-generated “Renewal At Risk in 90 Days” signal, clicks in to review product usage, escalations, and QBR history, then launches an approved Playbook that creates tasks, emails, and CRM fields — all governed by your policies. [upfrontoperations](https://www.upfrontoperations.com/blog/revops-tech-stack)

## 3. Architecture: Spine and services

Now we step down from the workspace into how it is actually wired. [pretius](https://pretius.com/blog/ai-knowledge-base-how-to-unify-company-information)

**High-level architecture**  
IntegrateWise is built as four layers:

1. **Connectors layer**
   - Bi-directional connectors into CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot), CS platforms, support tools, billing, product analytics, and data warehouse. [upfrontoperations](https://www.upfrontoperations.com/blog/how-to-build-a-revops-tech-stack)
   - Every connector maps its raw events and objects into a canonical schema before anything reaches the Spine. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-knowledgebase-architecture-design-center-assem-hijazi-naxaf)

2. **Spine (unified intelligence layer)**
   - A hybrid of relational/graph storage and semantic index, designed to hold the “one true” representation of your revenue entities: Account, Contact, Opportunity, Subscription, Ticket, RiskSignal, Playbook, Task, and more. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-knowledgebase-architecture-design-center-assem-hijazi-naxaf)
   - The Spine enforces the rule: **if it’s not in the Spine, it’s not wired** — all automation and AI must read from and write through the Spine, not directly to tools. [pretius](https://pretius.com/blog/ai-knowledge-base-how-to-unify-company-information)
   - Includes eligibility matrices, lineage, and access rules so every field has an origin and a governance policy. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-knowledgebase-architecture-design-center-assem-hijazi-naxaf)

3. **Intelligence & orchestration layer**
   - Orchestrates data ingest, enrichment, rules, and AI-based reasoning. [wizr](https://wizr.ai/blog/generative-ai-in-b2b-saas/)
   - Runs jobs that compute health scores, trend lines, anomalies, risk/opportunity signals, and suggested playbooks. [everafter](https://www.everafter.ai/blog/best-customer-facing-workspace-tools-b2b-saas-2026)
   - Manages read/write routing: which actions are safe to auto-execute, which require approval, and which are advisory-only. [itbrief.com](https://itbrief.com.au/story/stack-overflow-launches-stack-internal-to-unify-workplace-knowledge)

4. **Workspace (app) layer**
   - The app served at integratewise.ai/app, where users actually see Entity 360, Signals, Playbooks, and Approvals. [perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/a0ba9266-9e95-4ccf-885c-1a0ed24a5ed9)
   - Uses the Spine API as its only data source, so every view is consistent with the governed truth. [pretius](https://pretius.com/blog/ai-knowledge-base-how-to-unify-company-information)

You can think of the Spine as your **AI-ready RevOps data plane**, and the Workspace as your **operator console** built on top of it. [pretius](https://pretius.com/blog/ai-knowledge-base-how-to-unify-company-information)

## 4. Data model and entities

This section is for the person who cares about **schemas** and **entity design**. [upfrontoperations](https://www.upfrontoperations.com/blog/how-to-build-a-revops-tech-stack)

**Canonical entities**  
The Spine ships with a core, opinionated schema tailored to B2B SaaS RevOps and CS:

- **Account:** Normalized company record with stable identifiers, lifecycle stage, plan, MRR/ARR, key dates, and links to all subordinate events. [upfrontoperations](https://www.upfrontoperations.com/blog/revops-tech-stack)
- **Contact & Role:** Contacts attached to accounts, plus role metadata (economic buyer, champion, detractor, admin, power user). [upfrontoperations](https://www.upfrontoperations.com/blog/how-to-build-a-revops-tech-stack)
- **Opportunity / Deal:** Pipeline objects with forecast info, mapping back to the CRM but enriched with usage, NPS, and support context. [upfrontoperations](https://www.upfrontoperations.com/blog/revops-tech-stack)
- **Subscription / Contract:** Commercial truth: products, seats, terms, billing source-of-truth, renewal dates. [upfrontoperations](https://www.upfrontoperations.com/blog/how-to-build-a-revops-tech-stack)
- **Ticket / Case:** Support interactions, severity, response times, and linked product events. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-knowledgebase-architecture-design-center-assem-hijazi-naxaf)
- **RiskSignal / OpportunitySignal:** Spine-level signals with type, severity, evidence links, and recommended playbooks. [itbrief.com](https://itbrief.com.au/story/stack-overflow-launches-stack-internal-to-unify-workplace-knowledge)
- **Playbook & Task:** codified interventions and the atomic actions they trigger inside your stack. [everafter](https://www.everafter.ai/blog/best-customer-facing-workspace-tools-b2b-saas-2026)

**Mapping and lineage**

- Each field in the Spine has a **source map**: which system(s) it comes from, precedence rules, and transformation logic. [pretius](https://pretius.com/blog/ai-knowledge-base-how-to-unify-company-information)
- When two tools disagree (e.g., different renewal dates in billing vs CRM), the Spine records both and applies a deterministic “truth selection” rule your team defines. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-knowledgebase-architecture-design-center-assem-hijazi-naxaf)
- Every writeback from the Spine is recorded with who/what triggered it, which approval path it used, and a link to the entity version at that time. [itbrief.com](https://itbrief.com.au/story/stack-overflow-launches-stack-internal-to-unify-workplace-knowledge)

This gives you a true **RevOps knowledge graph**, not just a reporting join — so AI and automation operate on governed, explainable objects. [pretius](https://pretius.com/blog/ai-knowledge-base-how-to-unify-company-information)

## 5. Flow: from ingestion to governed action

This is the “how it works” sequence your buyer will read end-to-end. [growfusely](https://growfusely.com/blog/b2b-saas-landing-page-guide/)

**Step 1 – Connect and normalize**

- You connect Salesforce/HubSpot, support, billing, and product analytics using Spine connectors. [upfrontoperations](https://www.upfrontoperations.com/blog/revops-tech-stack)
- The system pulls recent history and sets up ongoing syncs, mapping raw objects into the Spine’s canonical schema with default playbooks for common fields. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-knowledgebase-architecture-design-center-assem-hijazi-naxaf)

**Step 2 – Build the Spine layer**

- The Spine reconciles IDs across tools and builds a unified Account graph with all related Contacts, Subscriptions, Tickets, and events. [pretius](https://pretius.com/blog/ai-knowledge-base-how-to-unify-company-information)
- It computes baselines: normal product usage patterns, typical ticket volume, healthy day-2 behavior after onboarding. [wizr](https://wizr.ai/blog/generative-ai-in-b2b-saas/)

**Step 3 – Generate signals and recommendations**

- Rules and AI models run on the Spine data to produce RiskSignals and OpportunitySignals: e.g., “Onboarding stalled,” “Champion churn risk,” “Usage up 3x in 60 days, upsell likely.” [wizr](https://wizr.ai/blog/generative-ai-in-b2b-saas/)
- Each signal includes machine evidence (charts, metrics, time windows) and human context (notes, emails, QBR outcomes where available). [itbrief.com](https://itbrief.com.au/story/stack-overflow-launches-stack-internal-to-unify-workplace-knowledge)

**Step 4 – Governed execution in the Workspace**

- CSMs and RevOps see these signals inside the Workspace, attached to Entity 360 instead of in a separate alert feed. [everafter](https://www.everafter.ai/blog/best-customer-facing-workspace-tools-b2b-saas-2026)
- From each signal, they can:
  - Launch an approved Playbook (e.g., “Run Save Motion – Champion Churn Risk”).
  - Approve specific writebacks (e.g., update CRM fields, create tickets, schedule tasks).
  - Escalate or suppress the signal with comments that become part of the Spine record. [itbrief.com](https://itbrief.com.au/story/stack-overflow-launches-stack-internal-to-unify-workplace-knowledge)

**Step 5 – Learning loop**

- The Spine tracks which signals were acted on and what happened (renewed, expanded, churned). [everafter](https://www.everafter.ai/blog/best-customer-facing-workspace-tools-b2b-saas-2026)
- Over time, it re-weights which patterns matter, which playbooks work, and which signals deserve attention — your workspace gets sharper the more you use it. [wizr](https://wizr.ai/blog/generative-ai-in-b2b-saas/)

## 6. Governance, safety, and approvals

This part is where you calm down the person who worries about AI going rogue in production systems. [pretius](https://pretius.com/blog/ai-knowledge-base-how-to-unify-company-information)

**Separation of concerns**

- **Read plane:** The Spine can read broadly from your stack, but what AI can see is further restricted by eligibility policies. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-knowledgebase-architecture-design-center-assem-hijazi-naxaf)
- **Suggest plane:** AI can suggest actions (field updates, emails, tasks) inside the Workspace, but they are drafts until approved. [itbrief.com](https://itbrief.com.au/story/stack-overflow-launches-stack-internal-to-unify-workplace-knowledge)
- **Write plane:** Only explicit, pre-defined Playbooks and approval paths can write back to CRM, CS, or billing. [pretius](https://pretius.com/blog/ai-knowledge-base-how-to-unify-company-information)

**Approval patterns**

- You define approval types like “RevOps only,” “Manager approval,” or “Auto-approve under threshold X.” [itbrief.com](https://itbrief.com.au/story/stack-overflow-launches-stack-internal-to-unify-workplace-knowledge)
- All writebacks are logged with who approved, under which policy, and what the Spine context was at that moment. [pretius](https://pretius.com/blog/ai-knowledge-base-how-to-unify-company-information)
- This makes every AI-assisted change auditable and reversible at the data level, not just the UI log. [itbrief.com](https://itbrief.com.au/story/stack-overflow-launches-stack-internal-to-unify-workplace-knowledge)

**Environment and blast radius control**

- You can start in “read-only Spine” mode: no writebacks, only signals and internal views. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-knowledgebase-architecture-design-center-assem-hijazi-naxaf)
- Then gradu­ally enable scoped writebacks (e.g., only to internal fields, only to sandbox CRM, only for low-risk playbooks) before going full production. [pretius](https://pretius.com/blog/ai-knowledge-base-how-to-unify-company-information)

## 7. Deployment, stack, and onboarding path

This is the “can we actually run this in our environment?” section. [upfrontoperations](https://www.upfrontoperations.com/blog/how-to-build-a-revops-tech-stack)

**Runtime and routing**

- Public marketing routes (integratewise.ai, /product, /contact) are separate from the authenticated Workspace at integratewise.ai/app/\*, routed through Cloudflare and a gateway/worker layer. [perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/a0ba9266-9e95-4ccf-885c-1a0ed24a5ed9)
- OAuth callbacks terminate at integratewise.ai/oauth/callback/:provider, so SSO and tool auth are centralized and governed. [perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/a0ba9266-9e95-4ccf-885c-1a0ed24a5ed9)

**Stack philosophy**

- Edge-first delivery (Cloudflare Workers/Pages) for low-latency workspace access, with the Spine and gateway services behind controlled APIs. [itbrief.com](https://itbrief.com.au/story/stack-overflow-launches-stack-internal-to-unify-workplace-knowledge)
- All Workspace calls go through the Spine gateway; there is no direct browser → CRM or browser → billing integration, which keeps your stack safer and easier to audit. [pretius](https://pretius.com/blog/ai-knowledge-base-how-to-unify-company-information)

**Customer onboarding**

1. **Access:** Your team signs in via SSO or email-based auth and lands in the app at integratewise.ai/app. [perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/a0ba9266-9e95-4ccf-885c-1a0ed24a5ed9)
2. **L0 onboarding:** A guided setup collects your GTM model, key entities, and which systems you use (Salesforce vs HubSpot, which CS tool, which billing system, etc.). [perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/7af1135a-92e7-4a40-9e5e-26b73f6eab24)
3. **First connectors:** You connect CRM, support, and billing. The Spine builds the initial graph and populates default health baselines and a starter set of signals. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-knowledgebase-architecture-design-center-assem-hijazi-naxaf)
4. **Workspace go-live:** CSMs and RevOps get a populated Workspace with Entity 360, Signals, and Playbooks configured for your schema. [growfusely](https://growfusely.com/blog/b2b-saas-landing-page-guide/)
5. **Governance rollout:** You phase in approvals and writebacks so the Spine becomes an active participant in your RevOps motions instead of just another dashboard. [itbrief.com](https://itbrief.com.au/story/stack-overflow-launches-stack-internal-to-unify-workplace-knowledge)

If you want, next I can:

- Tighten this into a single “builder prompt” optimized for your landing app (with tone instructions, headings, etc.), or
- Adapt the language to be sharper/more aggressive for a **technical founder/CTO** or more “systems & process” oriented for a **staff engineer** evaluating the stack.

Which one do you want me to optimize for first: keep it RevOps/CS-ops focused, or retarget this same structure for a technical founder/CTO?
