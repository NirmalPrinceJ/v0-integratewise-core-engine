# User Journey ≠ System Journey — Canonical Blueprint

## v3.7 — Frontend Layered Stack & Backend Stages Map

**Date:** June 18, 2026  
**Status:** Canonical architecture doctrine  
**Supersedes:** journey sections scattered across README.md, USER_FLOW_AND_VIEWS.md, FRONTEND_LAYER_MAP.md
**Companion doctrines:** [WORKBENCH_DOCTRINE.md](WORKBENCH_DOCTRINE.md), [DETAILED_USER_FLOWS_AND_SYSTEM_PATHS.md](DETAILED_USER_FLOWS_AND_SYSTEM_PATHS.md)

**Canonical Reference:** [CANONICAL_PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md](./CANONICAL_PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md)

> This document is downstream of the Canonical Platform Architecture. When this document contradicts the canonical architecture, the canonical architecture wins.

---

## 1. The Fundamental Model (User Spec)

All layers below are Workbench projections over governed Adaptive Spine context. No layer owns canonical truth; each layer renders the right projection for the user, Twin, governance, knowledge, or domain purpose.

Every user gets exactly two views — never more:

- **Personal** (always `PERSONAL` domain)
- **One Work workbench** (chosen once during onboarding — e.g. `CUSTOMER_SUCCESS`, `SALES`, `REVOPS`, `MARKETING`, `PRODUCT_ENGINEERING`, `BIZOPS`, etc.)

### Differentiation rules (locked):

- **L1 (main workbenches) + Memory layer (L4)** are differentiated by the chosen domain.
- **Everything else** (L2 overlay, L3 Twin, L5, L6, L7) is shared.

_Data Invariant:_ Data always comes from D1 Spine projections (never raw tool data). The chosen domain decides which `${domain}_data` partition (e.g. `grow_data`, `build_data`) you see in L1.

---

## 2. High-Level Flow

                ├── L2 Overlay (⌘J drawer) — always available on top
                ├── L3 Twin (shared chat/reasoning)
                ├── L4 Memory Hub (differentiated)
                ├── L5 Operations (shared)
                ├── L6 Execution (shared)
                └── L7 Governance (shared, HARD GATE)
```

## 3. Detailed Layer Breakdown

| Layer    | User Intent                               | What You See                                                                            | Domain Handling                                                                             | Backend Stages                                      | Current Status / How It Is Wired                                                                                                                                                          |

| **L0.5** | Always-On Operating Layer                 | No direct UI (background)                                                               | N/A (tenant + domain context)                                                               | Background jobs, crons, DO alarms                   | **Non-UI background layer.** Powered by stateful TwinAgent (TwinAgent DO daily reflex cron + TenantBrainDO DO per-tenant 15-min HITL timeout).                                            |
| **L1**   | User Workbench                            | Domain-specific dashboards (e.g. Account Success, Sales Pipeline, Personal Hub, BizOps) | Strictly differentiated. `activeDomain` + `contentDomain` decides the L1 surface            | S5 Spine Write + S4 Entity Resolution + projections | **Most mature layer.** Uses `DOMAIN_CONTENT_MAP` + per-domain modules (success/, salesops/, personal/, bizops/).

## 4. How the Layers Are Actually Wired Today

1. `AppShell` decides domain + `workspacePreference` (`"PERSONAL"` or `"WORK"`) from onboarding or restored D1 profile.
2. `WorkspaceShellNew` computes `contentDomain = activeView === "PERSONAL" ? "PERSONAL" : activeDomain`.
3. `ContentRouter` looks up `DOMAIN_CONTENT_MAP[contentDomain][moduleId]`.
4. Every domain map is augmented with shared `LAYER_MODULES`:

```javascript
const LAYER_MODULES = {
  twin,
  memory,
  operations,
  execution,
  governance,
};
const withLayerModules = (map) => ({ ...map, ...LAYER_MODULES });
```

5. L4–L7 all wrap content in the common `LayerShell` (consistent header, badge "L4"/"L5"/"L6"/"L7", system wire label, design tokens).

---

## 5. Backend System Stages (the invisible engine)

| Stage   | Purpose                | Key Component                                                                  |
| :------ | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S1**  | Connectivity           | Connectors / Nango / MCP                                                       |
| **S2**  | Loader                 | Ingest raw data                                                                |
| **S3**  | Normalizer (8-stage)   | `services/pipeline`                                                            |
| **S4**  | Entity Resolution      | Spine deduping                                                                 |
| **S5**  | Spine Write            | D1 `*_data` partitions (the source of truth)                                   |
| **S6**  | Intelligence           | Signals, think, proposals (`services/intelligence`)                            |
| **S7**  | Memory                 | Org + personal + conversational (`services/knowledge` + `services/continuity`) |
| **S8**  | Governance (HARD GATE) | Approvals, policies, audit                                                     |
| **S9**  | Continuity Bridge      | Assembled context                                                              |
| **S10** | Twin Runtime           | `iw-agent-runtime` (DOs)                                                       |
| **S11** | Execution              | Handoff / playbook dispatch                                                    |
| **S12** | Writeback              | Record outcomes                                                                |

_Important:_ The UI (all layers) only ever reads projections assembled from the Spine. Raw data is never shown.

---

## 6. Key Invariants

- **HARD GATE:** L7 is the only place that can mint an approval. L6 execution surface is dead without it.
- **Single Source of Truth:** D1 (`tenant_spine_config` + domain partitions). Gateway serves many reads directly.
- **Design System:** `--iw-forest` / `--iw-gold` + `iw-` classes (old blue/purple leaks have been cleaned in active paths).
- **Customer Zero Verification:** 7 real checkpoints (identity, connectors, hydration, spine, memory, continuity, twin) — all D1 queries, visible in admin.
- **No direct execution in product** except for IntegrateWise's own ops (Customer Zero).

---

## 7. Current Maturity (June 2026)

- **L0, L1, L2, L3:** Quite solid and in active use.
- **L4–L7:** "Routed shells" — they exist, use consistent `LayerShell`, call real APIs (`intelligence/proposals`, `knowledge/*`, etc.), and are available in every workbench. They are functional but lighter on custom domain-specific UI than L1.
- **L0.5:** Running in production background (DOs + crons).

_This is the actual as-built architecture after the recent fixes for domain scoping, design tokens, and layer consistency._

---

## 8. Exact Data Flow: L7 (Governance) → L6 (Execution)

Every execution proposal inside the product follows a governed, immutable lifecycle to maintain context integrity and enforce the execution boundary:

1. **Proposal Draft / Pending:** When the Twin or background intelligence normalizers detect a high-risk situation, a proposal is written to the D1 `governance_data` table in a `pending_review` status.
2. **Governance Workbench (L7) Approval:**
   - The operator opens L7 and clicks "Approve".
   - The web app sends a POST request to `/api/v1/intelligence/proposals/:id/approve` handled by `approveProposal()` in [services/govern/src/proposal.ts](file:///Users/nirmal/Github/integratewise-live/services/govern/src/proposal.ts).
   - The system checks `canTransition(status, 'approved')` to enforce valid state transition.
   - The status is updated to `approved`, the decision is cryptographically signed using a `signatureKey` via `logDecision()`, and written to the Spine audit logs.
3. **Execution Package Minting:**
   - Upon approval, the system automatically mints a first-class **Execution Package** inside the D1 `execution_packages` table.
   - This package captures the exact workflows (steps), tools (schemas), and context JSON payload required to execute the action.
4. **Execution Handoff (L6):**
   - **Customer Zero Flow (Internal Hermes Execution):**
     - `executeAction()` triggers asynchronously.
     - The proposal's state is set to `executing` in D1.
     - The system resolves the target entity type domain (e.g. `grow`, `build`) and executes direct SQLite SQL queries (`INSERT`/`UPDATE`) on the domain partitions (e.g., `grow_data`, `build_data`).
     - Relationships are recorded in `link_data`.
     - Execution outcomes and lineage are recorded in `recordLineage()`.
     - The proposal and execution package statuses transition to `completed`.
   - **External Customer Flow (Handoff):**
     - The Execution Package is exported in a vendor-neutral canonical JSON format.
     - The customer's execution agent (e.g., OpenClaw, crewAI, local CLI) fetches the package and updates status to `HANDED_OFF`.
     - The execution runs inside the customer's firewall.
     - Upon completion, the external runtime reports results back via a POST request to `/api/v1/handoff/outcome` containing the governance token. The gateway verifies the token, resolves status to `COMPLETED`, and writes the execution memory back to the Spine.

## 9. Context Hydration: How the Twin (L3) Gets Context

The Twin (`iw-agent-runtime`) is stateful and runs entirely inside Cloudflare Durable Objects. When a user sends a chat message, the Twin hydrates its context using a multi-step grounding pipeline before invoking the LLM:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Message] --> B[Continuity Retrieval]
    B --> C{Activation Check}
    C -- Failed --> D[Block with Hydration Message]
    C -- Passed --> E[Parallel Context Search]
    E --> F[aiSearch: semantic knowledge]
    E --> G[conversationalSearch: past sessions]
    E --> H[mcpSearch: connector assets]
    A --> I{Engineering Query?}
    I -- Yes --> J[spineReadEngineering: D1 build_data]
    I -- No --> K[Skip]
    F & G & H & J --> L[Combine & Slice Context]
    L --> M[DO SQLite: Warm history turns]
    M --> N[Learned Profile: Daily reflections]
    N --> O[Construct System Prompt]
    O --> P[gatewayChat: LLM Inference]
```

1. **Step 1: Continuity Assembly & Activation Gate:**
   - The Twin calls `assembleContinuity()` to fetch the user's conversational, organizational, and personal memory.
   - `evaluateActivation()` verifies if the tenant's memory database has passed the minimum threshold (e.g., 3+ total memories, 1+ promoted). If not, the Twin refuses to answer, providing a status message about current connectors and hydration progress to prevent hallucinations.
2. **Step 2: Parallel Context Search:**
   - The Twin performs parallel queries against:
     - `aiSearch`: Semantic chunks from the knowledge service.
     - `conversationalSearch`: Past chat memories in the hot cache.
     - `mcpSearch`: Connector resource schemas.
3. **Step 3: Engineering Intent Detection:**
   - If the query contains engineering-related terms (e.g., repository, pull request, merge, sprint, commit), the Twin calls `spineReadEngineering()`.
   - This performs a D1-direct read on the `build_data` partition (never querying live APIs), appending PRs, active repos, and blockers to the prompt context.
4. **Step 4: DO SQLite Warm Conversation Turns:**
   - The DO queries its local SQLite database `conversation_turns` table to fetch the 10 most recent message exchanges in the current session.
5. **Step 5: Evolving Personal Profile:**
   - The Twin loads its `learned_profile` block, which contains communication styles, risk tolerance signals, and success patterns extracted by the `dailyReflection` cron job.
6. **Step 6: Prompt Assembly & Gateway Chat:**
   - The Twin formats the retrieved context block, profile, and system prompt, and calls `gatewayChat()` to route the request through OpenRouter/OpenAI (with Workers AI fallback).
7. **Step 7: Memory Event Emission:**
   - The turn is written to local DO SQLite, and a session event is dispatched asynchronously to the continuity pipeline (`emitTriageInput`) to enrich the memory substrate.

## 10. Customer Zero Verification: The 7-Stage Checklist

The Customer Zero Verification state (implemented in [services/gateway/src/workspace-spine.ts](file:///Users/nirmal/Github/integratewise-live/services/gateway/src/workspace-spine.ts)) is a D1-direct checklist used to verify that a tenant is fully hydrated and functioning:

| Stage | Checkpoint Label | D1 Verification Query                                  | Target Done Condition                             |
