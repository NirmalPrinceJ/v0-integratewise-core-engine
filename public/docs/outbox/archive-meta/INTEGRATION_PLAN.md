## 🔌 THE WIRING GAPS (Critical Path)

### Gap 1: L3 → L2 Trigger

**Problem**: After data ingestion, Think Engine isn't auto-triggered  
**Solution**: Add event emitter from pipeline Stage 8 → Think Engine  
**Files**: `services/loader/pipeline.ts` → `services/think/index.ts`

### Gap 2: L2 → L1 Badges

**Problem**: Completeness scores don't show in UI  
**Solution**: Wire `spine_entity_completeness` → Frontend badges  
**Files**: `services/spine/` → `apps/web/components/ui/badge`

### Gap 3: Act Engine → UI

**Problem**: Approved actions don't execute  
**Solution**: Connect Govern approval → Act execution → Tool write-back  
**Files**: `services/govern/` → `services/act/` → Connectors

### Gap 4: Domain Shell Integration

**Problem**: Personal/CSM/Business shells exist but aren't wired  
**Solution**: Import Figma components → Wire to UnifiedShell  
**Files**: `components/domains/*/shell.tsx`

## 🔧 Technical Tasks

### Priority 1: Fix Package Resolution

```bash
# Build order for packages
1. packages/types
2. packages/lib
3. packages/db
4. packages/rbac
5. packages/connectors
6. packages/accelerators
7. packages/supabase
```

### Priority 2: Fix Import Paths

- `../../spine/spine-client` → `@/lib/spine/client`
- `@integratewise/connectors` → Build first
- `@integratewise/rbac` → Build first

### Priority 3: Event Bus

```typescript
// L3 → L2 Event Bus
interface PipelineEvent {
  type: "INGESTION_COMPLETE";
  payload: {
    tenantId: string;
    entityType: string;
    entityId: string;
  };
}

// Emit from pipeline Stage 8
// Listen in Think Engine
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

### Week 1 Success

- [ ] `pnpm build` completes without errors
- [ ] L3→L2 events flow correctly
- [ ] Badges update in real-time

### Week 2 Success

- [ ] All 3 domain shells render
- [ ] RBAC correctly routes users
- [ ] Data flows from Spine to UI

### Week 3 Success

- [ ] HITL approval flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Tool write-back executes correctly
- [ ] Audit trails are complete

### Week 4 Success

- [ ] <200ms API response time
- [ ] Zero critical bugs
- [ ] Production deployed

## 🎉 The Outcome

```
BEFORE: 5-6 months to production
AFTER:  2-4 weeks to production

The game has changed. We're not building—we're wiring.
```
